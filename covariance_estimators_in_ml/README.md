# Exploring the Effects of Different Covariance Estimators in Machine Learning

The general goal of this experiment is to explore different covariance estimators in the context
of machine learning. The different estimators explored are: Sample Covariance Estimator (SCE),
Linear Shrinkage Estimator by Ledoit-Wolf 2004 (LWE), and Rotationally Invariant
Estimators (RIE).
