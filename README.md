# Machine Learning Experiments
This repo contains general experiments related to Machine Learning and Artificial
Inteligence. If the experiments are more involved, they will be placed in separate folder.

### Genetic Algorithms and the Traveling Salesman

The following [repo](https://github.com/lmedeiro/C_Sharp_Repo/tree/master/lmedeiro_HW2_TSP)
contains work on a Genetic Algorithm based solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem. 

### Feature Engineering and Predictive Modeling for Financial Time Series

The following [repo](time_series_data/deep_learning_financial_time_series) contains work on deep learning and feature engineering applied to
Finanical Time Series. 

### Experimenting with Tensorflow 2.0 and Hyperparameter Optimization
