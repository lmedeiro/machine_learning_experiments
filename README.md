# Machine Learning Experiments
This repo contains general experiments related to Machine Learning and Artificial
Inteligence. If the experiments are more involved, they will be placed in separate folder.

### Genetic Algorithms and the Traveling Salesman

The following [repo](https://github.com/lmedeiro/C_Sharp_Repo/tree/master/lmedeiro_HW2_TSP)
contains work on a Genetic Algorithm based solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem. 

### Feature Engineering and Predictive Modeling for Financial Time Series

The following [repo](time_series_data/deep_learning_financial_time_series) contains work on deep learning
and feature engineering applied to Finanical Time Series. 

### Experimenting with Tensorflow 2.0 and Hyperparameter Optimization

The following [jupyter notebook](tensorflow_2-0-experiment.ipynb) contains an exercise with
Tensorflow 2.0, hyperparameter optimization, and the Fashion MNIST dataset. 

### Experiment with text and text prediction/interpretation

The resources located [here](text_experiments/) relate to an ongoing experiment that I am performing
on capturing information about a certain subject (hence the finance related books), and
the machine text response to arbitrary phrases. The goal is to investigate different models and
processing methods that will allow the machine to provide coherent responses, reflecting knowledge
on the subject ( a general theme in the training data).
