# Machine Learning Experiments
This repo contains general experiments related to Machine Learning and Artificial
Inteligence. If the experiments are more involved, they will be placed in separate folder.

### Genetic Algorithms and the Traveling Salesman

The following [repo](https://github.com/lmedeiro/C_Sharp_Repo/tree/master/lmedeiro_HW2_TSP)
contains work on a Genetic Algorithm based solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem. 

### Feature Engineering and Predictive Modeling for Financial Time Series

The following [repo](time_series_data/deep_learning_financial_time_series) contains work on deep learning
and feature engineering applied to Finanical Time Series. 

### Experimenting with Tensorflow 2.0 and Hyperparameter Optimization

The following [jupyter notebook](tensorflow_2-0-experiment.ipynb) contains an exercise with
Tensorflow 2.0, hyperparameter optimization, and the Fashion MNIST dataset. 

### Experiment with text and text prediction/interpretation

The resources located [here](text_experiments/) relate to an ongoing experiment that I am performing
on capturing information about a certain subject (hence the finance related books), and
the machine text response to arbitrary phrases. The goal is to investigate different models and
processing methods that will allow the machine to provide coherent responses, reflecting knowledge
on the subject ( a general theme in the training data). 

### Junction 2019 Mental Health Challenge

During the Junction 2019 challenge our team tried to propose a solution for the mental 
health challenge that exists in Finland. Our solution, which is 
[here](https://github.com/andersnylund/mood-penguin/tree/18e4c74ac9059b529a14ab2509330c6bc2d05990)
was composed of a mobile web tool 
where users can log their feelings. The goal is to ingest this data and through NLP and 
Machine Learning produce some data-driven feedback that is able to help up-lift users. 

The components developed thus far was the NLP system, produced by a microsoft azure 
cognitive service, and information logging for the user.

### Evaluation of Different Covariance Estimators in the Context of PCA Feature Engineering for Convolutional Neural Networks Image Classification

On [this repo](https://github.com/lmedeiro/covariance_estimators_in_machine_learning)
you will find a project in which different covariance estimators are evaluated in the context
of PCA feature engineering. The model is a simple CNN LeNet5 model, performing
classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The general goal is to evaluate how classfication
performance will change as a function of the the number of samples avaible for training
(images in this case) and the different covariance estimators.
